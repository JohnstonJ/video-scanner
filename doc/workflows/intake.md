# Tape intake

Follow this procedure when processing a batch of tapes.

1.  Add labels (e.g. sticky notes) that number each tape.  For example, tapes from John Smith might be labeled "J Smith #1", "J Smith #2", etc.
2.  Make a note on the label of the actual video format that was recorded (e.g. Digital8, Hi8).  This aids with following the correct workflow later on.
    -   If unsure, play back the tape in **AUTO** mode, and observe the icon on the camcorder's preview screen to see what format the camcorder identified.
    -   When capturing, beware of tapes that could have both analog and digital formats recorded on the same tape.  If encountered, those sections should be captured separately.
        -   When capturing analog in Hi8-only playback mode, beware of "blank" sections of tape, or tape that has sections of static/noise.
        -   When capturing digital in **AUTO** playback mode, beware of video that shows analog artifacts, like head switching noise, horizontal blanking pixels, etc.
